# iOS-TodosApp

This is the very first Swift app after learning for 2 weeks straight. 

So I would like to share the journy and what did I do to achieve this Goal. 

# Swift

Follow along the [Swift](https://swift.org) documentation. Try to code along the examples. Just go through the documentation even if you don't understand the whole 
thing just try to read all the documentation and get yourself aware with the concepts. This is will help later while reading the code of some
open source project. 

And.. read the documentation again. This is what I am doing now, this time try to understand and repeat until it becomes muscle memory. this is ongoing process.

#SwiftUI

Follow the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/SwiftUI) tutorials and try to recreate them. 

#Videos

One of my colleague suggested WWDC videos and watch them in the order.
